# About
My few years of experience have allowed me to use many technologies. But my main development is often focused on the interaction of electronics by the final user. I programmed embedded systems (C, Neuron C), implemented communication protocols (C,C#),developed desktop/web applications (C#, Javascript, typescript, Python, qml) allowing the interaction of different systems.  
  
I also had the opportunity to develop various additional skills, very useful for a developer: setting up test setup, continuous integration (TeamCity), Web server (Nginx, IIS), deployment system (Inno Setup, RPM, Python package), bash and linux script, virtual machine, source manager (SVN, Git), database (SQL Server), Docker. And, in a private setting, I had the opportunity to work with an Arduino and Raspberry pi.
